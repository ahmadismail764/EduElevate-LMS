# EduElevate Learning Management System (LMS)

## � Status: Core Foundation Complete (~65%)

Spring Boot LMS with JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and comprehensive user/course management.

**✅ Complete**: User management, Course enrollment, API testing  
**⚠️ Pending**: Educational features (lessons, quizzes, assignments, grading)

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Backend**: Spring Boot + Spring Security + JWT
- **Database**: H2 (development) with SQL schema
- **Testing**: JUnit + Mockito (unit tests) + JavaScript (API tests)
- **Structure**: Clean N-tier (Entities → Repositories → Services → Controllers → DTOs)

## 📊 Features Complete

### ✅ User Management System

- **Students, Instructors, Admins**: Full CRUD operations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login/registration
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Security**: Password encryption, token validation

### ✅ Course Management System

- **Courses**: Create, update, delete, search
- **Enrollment**: Student enrollment with status tracking
- **Analytics**: Course statistics and reporting
- [x] **Controller Layer**: REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### ✅ External API Testing (Complete)

- **JavaScript Test Suite**: `test-api.js` for comprehensive endpoint testing
- **24 Test Cases**: Authentication, CRUD operations, security validation
- **JSON Reporting**: Automated test reports with pass/fail metrics

### ⏸️ Java Unit Testing (Postponed)

_Java unit and integration testing has been temporarily postponed to focus on core feature development. Will be resumed Insha'Allah after completing the main educational features._

- **Planned Testing Strategy**: Vertical slicing approach (complete one module before moving to next)
- **Target Modules**: Student Management → Course Management → Authentication
- **Test Types**: Service layer (unit), Repository layer (integration), Controller layer (web)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start the application
cd lms
mvn spring-boot:run

# 2. Run API tests (server must be running)
node test-api.js
```

**Application**: `http://localhost:8080/api`  
**Database**: H2 Console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Complete Lesson Management**: Finish lesson CRUD operations and content delivery
2. **Educational Features**: Add quizzes, assignments, and grading system
3. **Advanced Features**: Progress tracking, notifications, and analytics
4. **Java Unit Testing**: Resume comprehensive testing suite (postponed)
